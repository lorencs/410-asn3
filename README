I used two external JavaScript files. One contained functions I used to validate my signup page, and the other was linked
from all the quiz pages and contained functions related to modifying the HTML of those pages.

For the signup form validation I used mostly my code from the labs. To avoid convoluted birthdate validation I simply used
combo boxes generated using JavaScript.

As suggested, I used JS to show and hide divisions in order to simulate the navigation through questions.

The timers were the trickiest part. At first I saved the current Date to a var, and then subtracted that var from the current 
Date to get the time elapsed. This didn't work for the "question timer" as it needed to pause if the question wasn't active.
So I saved the question timer as a Date object with time set to 0 (.setTime(0)). Then, at each interval of the update function, 
I would add to that date the different between current time, and the date it was last updated. (If I simply added 100ms at each
interval, it could get innacurate due to cpu delay, and also it didn't update if the browser window was minimized)
Since the timers are accurate to 100ms (I call the update function every 100ms, otherwise the question timers could be off by 1sec), 
in the end the question timers might not add up to the main timer. For example if they are 3.4, 3.4, and 3.4, they will all round 
down to 3, while the main timer will round down from 10.2 to 10.

For the progress bar I used a div whose width was controlled by JavaScript.

If a user attempted to access the quiz pages before registering, I hid the entire quiz and showed instructions to first register
before trying to access the quizes.
